# Navigation Behaviors - Tasks

1. Identify necessary behaviors.
    1. For each behavior extract the topics it will accept and the algorithms it will cover.
    2. For each behavior estimate time to implement, along with it's launcher, time to integrate and validate it.
    3. For each behavior plan some scenarios to test the behavior
    4. For each behavior implement, integrate, create the scenario and validate the behavior.

## 1. Identified Behaviors
