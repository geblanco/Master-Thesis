\chapter{Building Scenario Simulation}

  ToDo := In the following chapter we present the simulation scenario used to test the proposed behavior...

  The build scenario simulation will serve as a testbed for the distributed belief memory. For this purpose we propose various scenarios of incremental difficulty.

  \section{Requirements}

    Every scenario should provide a central grid where the building is going to be built and a separate grid with blocks for every drone to use. Additionally, the figure to build should be given before hand.

  \section{Difficulty}

    As a measure for how difficult the task is we will...
