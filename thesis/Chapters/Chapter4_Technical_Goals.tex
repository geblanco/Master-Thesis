In this chapter, the technical goals of the project are introduced. Namely, each developed module will be explained as well as it's requirements and it's specification details. For each module, it will be explored:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The technical goals
  \item The problem to which the module provides a solution
  \item Some of it's properties (reusability, scalability \dots)
  \item Integration with the current version of Aerostack
\end{itemize}

\section{Technical Goals}
% ToDo := introduce the goals: problem and solution each module solves

\section{Specification}
% ToDo := for each module, explain the specification of the module: what it requires (hardware and software components), refresh rate, implentation details...

\section{Integration}
% ToDo := How does the module integrates with the current state of Aerostack
