\chapter{Validation}

  This chapter will go through all the validation and tests implemented to measure the perfomance and the correct functioning of the new behaviors. 

  To validate each implemented behavior we propose using them both in simulation and in real flight missions. The validation tests are presented in detail in section \ref{ch_5:sect:val_tests}, explaining what the tests measure and how they do it as well as the intuition behind each test. Afterwards, in section \ref{ch_5:sect:simulation} we will epose the simulator used and it's particularities as well as how it is integrated with the current version of Aerostack. It will be followed by the specification of the aircraft used for the real flight mission in section \ref{ch_5:sect:real_flight} to finish with some conclusions in section \ref{ch_5:sect:conclusions}.
