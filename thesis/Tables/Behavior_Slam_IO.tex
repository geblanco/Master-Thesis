\begin{itemize}
  \item scan: This is the output of the lidar node, it is directly fed into the \textit{hector mapping} node
  \item imu: This topic contains the measures from the \textit{inertial measurement unit}
  \item odometry: This is a general topic with the measures from odometry
  \item map lidar: Map output from \textit{hector mapping}, used as internal representation for the behavior.
  \item pose lidar: Pose output from \textit{hector mapping}, used as internal representation for the behavior and input to EKF fusion module.
  \item map: This is the map as processed by the \textit{hector mapping} node
  \item pose ekf fusion: This is the estimated speed from the whole behavioor process, fed to the selector.
  \item speed ekf fusion: Estimated pose from the whole behavioor process, fed to the selector.
