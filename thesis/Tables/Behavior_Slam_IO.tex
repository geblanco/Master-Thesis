\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{scan}: This is the output of the lidar node, it is directly fed into the \textit{hector mapping} node
  \item \textbf{imu}: This topic contains the measures from the \textit{inertial measurement unit}
  \item \textbf{odometry}: This is a general topic with the measures from odometry
  \item \textbf{map lidar}: Map output from \textit{hector mapping}, used as internal representation for the behavior.
  \item \textbf{pose lidar}: Pose output from \textit{hector mapping}, used as internal representation for the behavior and input to EKF fusion module.
  \item \textbf{map}: This is the map as processed by the \textit{hector mapping} node
  \item \textbf{pose ekf fusion}: This is the estimated speed from the whole behavioor process, fed to the selector.
  \item \textbf{speed ekf fusion}: Estimated pose from the whole behavioor process, fed to the selector.
